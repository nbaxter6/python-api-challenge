# python-api-challenge
This repository contains work for WeatherPy and VacationPy challenge projects for Week 6 of EdX's data analysis bootcamp hosted by the Univerity of Oregon. 
Weatherpy uses OpenWeatherMap API to collect weather information from cities all around the world. This information was aggregated into a dataframe and saved in the my_output_date folder. Four scatter plots were created and linear regression analysis was completed on the four relationships separated into northern and southern hemisphere data. 
Vacationpy uses the data collected from Weatherpy and Geoapify to determine the ideal vacation spot based on weather conditions and then locate the nearest hotel. This project is incomplete as the hotel identification portion is not working. 

Starter code for both Weatherpy And Vacationpy were provided by EdX.
